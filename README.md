# LAND-PRICE-PREDICTION-BASED-ON-SQUARE-FEET-USING-LINEAR-REGRESSION
This Project is based on Machine Learning with Python which will help in Calculating the price of land according to size of land in square feet. We will provide data to it then it will check accordingly to the Provided dataset.I have used Linear Regression algorithm for prediction
